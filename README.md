Proteomics Analysis of Serum Antibodies web server

<p align="justify">
PASA web server allows generating quantitative molecular measurements related to serum antibody repertoire from high-resolution proteomic data. The web server is applicable for researchers at all levels that are interested in addressing basic questions related to B cell development and differentiation, as well as an application focused tool for vaccine development, immunodiagnostic discovery and monoclonal antibody engineering. For further details please refer to https://pasa.tau.ac.il/. PASA is also available as a command line application. For further details download the PASA project and run <i>local_project_path/src/backend/pipeline/main.py -h</i>.
